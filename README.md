# Dance O'clock: the motion-deactivated alarm clock.

## Introduction
College students are perennially exhausted, and getting out of bed is often a painful ordeal involving several sound-based alarms that are frequently snoozed or slept through. To alleviate the struggles faced by students in waking up in the morning, we introduce Dance Oâ€™clock, a motion-deactivated alarm clock program that utilizes the motion-capture capabilities of the Microsoft Kinect. Dance O'clock's capabilities include: recording a physical movement routine using the Kinect camera, setting an alarm with a series of user-customized parameters, and deactivation of a set alarm by performing the previously recorded movements. 

Dance O'clock was designed and developed from the holistic perspective of human-computer interaction; the original design was built upon an initial questionnaire of 26 college students around the world, which gauged their needs and feelings towards a movement-deactivated alarm system, and throughout the development process, the design components and functionalities were constantly adjusted accoring to real-time feedback from potential users.
