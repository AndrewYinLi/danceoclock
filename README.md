# Dance O'clock: the motion-deactivated alarm clock.

## Introduction
College students are perennially exhausted, and getting out of bed is often a painful ordeal involving several sound-based alarms that are frequently snoozed or slept through. To alleviate the struggles faced by students in waking up in the morning, we introduce Dance O’clock, a motion-deactivated alarm clock program that utilizes the motion-capture capabilities of the Microsoft Kinect. Dance O'clock's capabilities include: recording a physical movement routine using the Kinect camera, setting an alarm with a series of user-customized parameters, and deactivation of a set alarm by performing the previously recorded movements. 

Dance O'clock was designed and developed from the holistic perspective of human-computer interaction; the original design was built upon an initial questionnaire of 26 college students around the world, which gauged their needs and feelings towards a movement-deactivated alarm system, and throughout the development process, the design components and functionalities were constantly adjusted accoring to real-time feedback from potential users. 

## How to Use Dance O'clock
Using the Dance O'clock application, you can do the following, after connecting a Microsoft Kinect 2.0 sensor:
1. Open and read the help menu, which has helpful tips and instructions for using the program.
2. Record an action using the Kinect camera, and specify the length of recording, frame sample rate (these are the frames that are saved and matched with the frames that are performed during alarm deactivation), and the file saving options. The saved files contain the angles between limbs at each important body joint, which is captured at the specified sample rate by the Kinect sensor. The Dance O'clock package includes five preset movements.
3. Create and set up a new alarm with a selected recorded action, along with any valid .mp3 file to play during 
4. Modify one of the alarm’s attributes.
5. Wait for the alarm to go off, and then perform the required actions to deactivate the alarm.
